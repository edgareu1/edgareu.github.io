## Reflection

This was a 3 week long project followed by numerous improvements in the following months.

It was built without external dependencies and with the educational purpose of better understanding the basics of web development. From the GitHub calendar to the carousels, every feature was created with only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

At the end of the project I added webpack as a dependency in order to improve the project's performance by bundling the production files. Some of the webpack packages I used were: Babel, Minify, PostCSS and Sass.
